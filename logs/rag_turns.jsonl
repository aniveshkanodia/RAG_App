A Microfactory costs 25-50% less than a traditional or fully custom automated line. This is because modules use 70% of the same components (frame, power, safety, conveyor system), meaning that you benefit from producing multiple modules at the same time.\n- 2 .  Development and assembly time is typically 50% less than a fully automated custom line, meaning you can get to market faster, leveraging first mover advantage.
